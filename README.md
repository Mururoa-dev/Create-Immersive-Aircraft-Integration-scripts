# Create Immersive aircrafts integration scripts

I use these scripts to modify my server using [Kubesjs](https://kubejs.com/) and its create integration ([see here](https://kubejs.com/wiki/addons/create)).
The main reason to use kubjs instead of a datapack is that Kubejs-create allow the registration of custom items without having to create (pun intended) your own mod.
We need those customs intems to make transitional items for sequence recipes (e.g. the `uncomplete precision mechanism` from Create).

I made custom textures for uncomplete items based on this [Ressource pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/create-immersive-aircrafts-resource-pack) by `nicky__21`. I recommend using this one.

## How to install 

1. Install Kubejs for your minecraft world.
2. Copy these scripts in the `kubejs` folder for your world/server.
